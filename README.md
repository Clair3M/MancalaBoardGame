# README
This program is a game created for an object oriented programming course where we were tasked with creating our own versions of the board games Mancala and Ayoayo. I makes use of Java Swing for the UI components and was tested using the the JUnit framework. The project was a combination of multiple assignments over a month and helped me learn how to incorporate OO design concepts such as inheretence, interfaces, and single responsibility in programs. In addition, I learned how to take advantage of event listeners to build an event driven program.

The assignment was created by Judi McCuaig
