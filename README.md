# README
This program is a game created for an object oriented programming course where we were tasked with creating our own versions of the board games Mancala and Ayoayo.

# Known Issues
Viewing the game rules currently doesn't work because the program trys to access a file in a very specific filepath that doesn't work unless the program is run from the program home directory.
