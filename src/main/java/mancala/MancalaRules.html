<big>How to Play Mancala</big>
<p>
    <strong>Playing Mancala:</strong>
    <br/>
    The game begins with one player picking a pit and picking up all of the stones within. Moving counter-clockwise, the player places one 
    <br/>
    stone into each pit until they are out of stones.
    <br/><br/>
    <strong>Rules</strong>
    <br/>
    1.  If you run into your own store while placing stones, place a stone in the pit. If you run into the other players store, skip it.<br/>
    2.  If you place the last stone into your own pit, you get an extra turn.<br/>
    3.  If you place the last stone into an empty pit on your side, you capture that piece and any pieces in the pit directly across from it.<br/>
    4.  Always place all captured stones into your store.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    <strong>Winning the Game</strong>
    <br/>
    The game ends when all 6 pits on one side of the board are empty. The player who still has stones on their side of the board captures all
    <br/>
    those stones. The winner is whoever has the most stones in their store.
