<big>How to Play Ayoayo</big>
<p>
    <strong>Playing Ayoayo:</strong>
    <br/>
    The game begins with one player picking a pit and picking up all of the stones within. Moving counter-clockwise, the player 
    <br/>
    places one stone into each pit until they are out of stones. If the last stone is placed into a pit that already had stones,
    <br/>
    pick up those stones and continue.
    <br/><br/>
    <strong>Rules</strong>
    <br/>
    1.  If you travel all the way around the board while placing stones, do not place stones into the starting pit.<br/>
    2.  If you place the last stone into an empty pit on your side, you capture any pieces in the pit directly across from it.<br/>
    4.  Always place all captured stones into your store.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    <strong>Winning the Game</strong>
    <br/>
    The game ends when all 6 pits on one side of the board are empty. The player who still has stones on their side of the 
    <br/>
    board captures all those stones. The winner is whoever has the most stones in their store.
